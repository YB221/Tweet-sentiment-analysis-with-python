# Tweet-sentiment-analysis-with-python
Here is a piece of code based on python to categorize and analyze tweets of your desired #TAG ,person company etc. which can be very useful if you are a data scientist or puruing some research or just wanna have some fun cause twitter is the place you can grab the crowd's thoughts and inclinations very sophistically. lets get started:-
# software-side

this is a very simple code in python which uses pre-defined libraries 'TWEEPY' and 'TEXTBLOB'.another library is used to visualize the data 'matplotlib'
# spyder editor
I prefer spyder editor both in LINUX and windows to write and execute the code,it is pre installed in anaconda and can be installed from software manager in LINUX

# installation

1. so to get started download latest version of anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download/ for windows or you can use any LINUX
2. after installation run anaconda prompt or LINUX terminal and type "pip install tweepy" (without "")
3. it will seek permission to install the package you give it by pressing Y and hit enter
4. after installation is complete in anaconda prompt or LINUX teminal  type "pip install textblob" (without "")
5. again it will seek permission to install the package you give it by pressing Y and hit enter
6.after installation is complete in anaconda prompt or LINUX terminal  type "pip install matplotlib" (without "")
7. again it will seek permission to install the package you give it by pressing Y and hit enter
8. after this installation,we talk about twitter api you need to sign up for a devoloper account on twitter and create an app(https://youtu.be/M_gGUqhCJoU) to get api keys.
9. now we are set to understand and run the code embeded in this repository.
10. run the code and enjoy!

# results 
in the end you will have a sentiment analysis of your search and extracted tweets will be saved in a CSV  file in the directory you ran the code.it will also produce a pie chart of sentiments.
