# Tweet-sentiment-analysis-with-python
Here is a piece of code based on python to categorize and analyze tweets of your desired #TAG ,person company etc. which can be very useful if you are a data scientist or puruing some research or just wanna have some fun cause twitter is the place you can grab the crowd's thoughts and inclinations very sophistically. lets get started:-

1. this is a very simple code in python which uses two pre-defined libraries 'TWEEPY' and 'TEXTBLOB'.
2. so to get started download latest version of anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download/
3. after installation run anaconda prompt and type "pip install tweepy" (without "")
4. it will seek permission to install the package you give it by pressing Y and hit enter
5. after installation is complete in anaconda prompt  type "pip install textblob" (without "")
6. again it will seek permission to install the package you give it by pressing Y and hit enter
7. after this installation,we talk about twitter api you need to sign up for a devoloper account on twitter and create an app(https://youtu.be/M_gGUqhCJoU) to get api keys.
8. now we are set to understand and run the code embeded in this repository.
